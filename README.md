# CodeLouisville-Front-End-Project
Requirements:

Your project is responsive to different devices and/or browser sizes/resolutions. At minimum, it must have 3 different displays/views, meaning 2 media queries/breakpoints or other forms of responsiveness. You do not have to account for all possible devices, but your user experience should change to improve as screen size or device viewing changes.

Your project includes utilizes at least one front-end framework or library of your choice. This includes - but is not limited to - jQuery, AJAX, and/or Angular.

Your code has comments. Every line doesn’t need a comment, but major sections of your CSS, HTML, and/or JavaScript files should have some helpful comments so a reviewer can know what the code does.

Your project code is on your GitHub account in its own repository. If you choose to host your application on a live URL, GREAT! You can share that for demonstration purposes or ease of running - and this is encouraged! But your code must still be available on GitHub for review.

It must include a README file located at the top level directory of your project providing the following:

A brief description of your project’s purpose. Example: "A website for my local animal shelter. I tried to enhance their current site by implementing more responsive design and adding some jQuery functionality to create a Contact Me form." Try to think of what would be useful to a potential employer that is looking at your GitHub account without any context or background about Code Louisville or your project.
Detailed steps on how to view the website. For most projects, this may just be "Run index.html" But some projects may go beyond these requirements and require specific tools or setup to run. If your project does, be sure to include very detailed steps so a reviewer or an employer can successfully run your project. If you choose to host your site on a live URL or GitHub Pages, it is fine to list that URL instead.

Purpose of the Project:


Propose to the Ministry Support Cuba, an example of how to share the literary resources it possesses through the use of the web in an interactive, simple and pleasant way.

How to use This First Version:

The first view that we find is a representation of the 6 areas that make up the Cuba Support Ministry
Through Books.

Areas are:
Family
Counseling
Leadership
Teach with life
Youth Ministry
Resource Center.

Second View is an approach to the Book with a brief description of the area to which it belongs, this is when we click on the image of the book.

And Third and Ultima Vista is the direct access to the book, which we can
- read directly when we choose the read button (in blue), of the modal box.
- close if we choose the close button (in white color) of the modal box.

For reasons of prefection once we are in the view of the book itself to avoid the total closure of the project. We must choose the back arrow in the left corner of the browser.

In later versions, we will improve this result.

How to view de website:
Run index.html
