# CodeLouisville-Front-End-Project
Requirements:

Your project is responsive to different devices and/or browser sizes/resolutions. At minimum, it must have 3 different displays/views, meaning 2 media queries/breakpoints or other forms of responsiveness. You do not have to account for all possible devices, but your user experience should change to improve as screen size or device viewing changes.

Your project includes utilizes at least one front-end framework or library of your choice. This includes - but is not limited to - jQuery, AJAX, and/or Angular.

Your code has comments. Every line doesn’t need a comment, but major sections of your CSS, HTML, and/or JavaScript files should have some helpful comments so a reviewer can know what the code does.

Your project code is on your GitHub account in its own repository. If you choose to host your application on a live URL, GREAT! You can share that for demonstration purposes or ease of running - and this is encouraged! But your code must still be available on GitHub for review.

It must include a README file located at the top level directory of your project providing the following:

A brief description of your project’s purpose. Example: "A website for my local animal shelter. I tried to enhance their current site by implementing more responsive design and adding some jQuery functionality to create a Contact Me form." Try to think of what would be useful to a potential employer that is looking at your GitHub account without any context or background about Code Louisville or your project.
Detailed steps on how to view the website. For most projects, this may just be "Run index.html" But some projects may go beyond these requirements and require specific tools or setup to run. If your project does, be sure to include very detailed steps so a reviewer or an employer can successfully run your project. If you choose to host your site on a live URL or GitHub Pages, it is fine to list that URL instead.

Purpose of the Project:

Provide access to the resources of Cuba Support Ministry through the web in a very interactive and simple way.

How to viwe de website:
